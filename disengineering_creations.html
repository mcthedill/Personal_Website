            <h2>The Resonanzkorper</h2>
            <p>This is one of the creations I am happiest with. It's tuned into just intonation,
                and it uses the most basic, frankly coolest circuit, which uses the CD40106 chip. The 
                actual instrument only has two of these chips in it, one to control the drone note, and
                another for all the buttons. When you press a button, the resistance of that circuit changes,
                which ultimately changes the pitch. There's also a zine that discusses the Resonanzkorper
                further, but I don't have access to it right now. Perhaps I'll upload that someday.
